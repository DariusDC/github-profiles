# Github Profiles

This app is made for the users who want to see their github profile (or others) in a nicer way.
The users only needs to search for the github profile he wants to look for and then he will see two charts:
- One for the most starred repositories he has
- One for the most used programming languages on it's projects.

I have built this project in order to improve my front-end design skills. 
Technologies used: 
- react
- typescript
- react-flip-card
- styled-components
- chart.js
